A series of python scripts that grabs the flags from a well-known wargame. Keeping to the rules and not spoiling by saying which one it is...

### How to run
To use the scripts, simply create a file called "levels_credentials.py" in the format:

	credentials = [
	       {"level": "[REDACTED]", "password":"[REDACTED]", "url":"[REDACTED]"},
	       {"level": "[REDACTED]", "password":"[REDACTED]", "url":"[REDACTED]"},
	       ...
	]

Then run...
